# pomodoro_daily_chart.py #

Author: Brett Hutley <brett@hutley.net>

This code is to extract the list of Pomodoros from my Mac OS/X calendar using the program [callistevents](https://github.com/bhutley/callistevents) and then create a bar-chart aggregating the work done each hour, in order to show how my productivity looks during the day.

It will create a chart called prod_YYYY-MM-DD.png in the current directory.

In order to run it, you will need to modify the path to the callistevents program by changing the callistevents_prog variable.
